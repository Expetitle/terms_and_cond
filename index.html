          <p>
            We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We
            only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us

            Some of our third-party applications may use cookies on our site

            From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys.
            Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary

            site.

            SECTION 2 - YOUR ACCESS TO AND CONTROL OVER INFORMATION
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can
            do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address
            or phone number given on our website:

          </p>
          <p>
            Change/correct any data we have about you.

            SECTION 3 - SECURITY
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
            sensitive information via the website, your information is protected
            both online and offline.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as personally
            identifiable information), that information is encrypted and
            transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking
            for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the
            beginning of the address of the Web page.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
            online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who
            need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing
            or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
            information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
            identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you
            should contact us immediately via email at closing@expetitle.com.
